Things need to take real care of when running sensitivity analysis:

1. For different number of roots
- make sure that the flow condition, the flow rate is consistent, a flow of O2-fluid is slowly built up, make sure that the first few time points of the flow condition reduces with the increasing number of roots as well, not just the main flow rate

- make sure that the plant-mediated transport of CH4 umax is set up according to the number of roots, and also watch out the threshold for Tracer2, because with the same injection rate but different number of roots, the threshold of Tracer2 would change


2. For reaction rate constants
- when change K, also change umax

3. Always check carefully, the reaction rate constants, the O2 injection rate
